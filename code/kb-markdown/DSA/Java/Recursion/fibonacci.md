Fibbonacci means next element in series is the sum of previous 2 numbers // 0 1
Tribonacci means next element in series is the sum of previous 3 numbers // 0 0 1
N-bonacci means next element in series is the sum of previous n numbers // 0 0 0 .. n - 1 times zero then 1

Since fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) // 2 recursive calls

Let n = 4
T(4) = time required to compute 4th fibonacci number // T(n)
T(3) = time required to compute 3rd fibonacci number // T(n - 1)
T(2) = time required to compute 2nd fibonacci number // T(n - 2)

T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + some constant work
T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + 1 // we can replace constant with 1
