## Binary exponentiation

### Algorithm

we need to calculate 2 ^ 13

Result | Base | Power | Nature | Todo
-|-|-|-|-
1 | 2 | 13 | odd | power-- and result *= base
2 | 2 | 12 | even | power = power / 2 and base = base * base
2 | 4 | 6 | even | power = power / 2 and base = base * base
2 | 16 | 3 | odd | power-- and result *= base
32 | 16 | 2 | even | power = power / 2 and base = base * base
32 | 256 | 1 | odd | power-- and result *= base
8192 | 256 | 0 | even | since power is 0 so res is answer

### code

``` 
static int binaryExponentiation(int base, int power) {
    int result = 1;
    while (power != 0) {
        if ((power & 1) == 1) {
            power--;
            result *= base;
        }
        // we have even power now
        power = power >> 1; // divide by 2
        base *= base;
    }
    return result;
}
```
